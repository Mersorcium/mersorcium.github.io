# How to add new events

You can post a new events in the "Events" side menu by the following 2 steps:

1. Uploading the poster image to the folder [posters](posters)
2. Editing the text content in the file [1-events](category/1-events.md).

Here is how to do them (not so hard!):

## Step 1: Uploading the poster image

Click and enter the folder [posters](posters)

Then edit the content:

![edit](how-to-post/edit_events.jpg)

**The post should obey the following format:**

Every event is a formatted `block` (circled in red below), so you can copy and paste a previous `block` and then edit the content.
